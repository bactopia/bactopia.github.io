# Enhancements to Open-Source Software

Sustaining open source software is a difficult challenge that often demands substantial time
and effort, usually without the benefit of recognition or support. The field of bioinformatics
is no exception, as it heavily depends on tools maintained by individuals with little to no 
support. Bactopia is no different.

Recognizing these challenges, I designed Bactopia with an explicit goal of giving back to the
community. To fulfill this aim, I incorporated several key design requirements:

1. Tools must open source and free to use.
2. Tools must be available from conda
3. Bactopia Tools must be available on [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules)

!!! tip "Bactopia has provided {{ total_contributions }}+ contributions to the bioinformatics community"
    - [x] {{ tools | length }} stand-alone tools, each available from Bioconda
    - [x] {{ conda_submissions | length }} new Conda recipes, {{ conda_updates | length }} 
    updated recipes, and [2,000+ Bioconda pull requests reviewed](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+involves%3Arpetit3+is%3Aclosed).
    - [x] {{ nfcore_modules | length }} contributions to nf-core/modules
    - [x] {{ other | length }} contributions to other tools
    
    These contributions are to the wider community, and do not require you to use Bactopia to take advantage of them.

## Stand-Alone Tools

Sometimes, tools are developed to enhance Bactopia capabilities, such as
[Dragonflye](https://github.com/rpetit3/dragonflye), which was developed to add Nanopore
support. These tools are designed to function as stand-alone tools. Below
are {{ tools | length }} such tools, originally built for Bactopia, that you can also use
independent of Bactopia.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
{% for tool in tools | sort(attribute='tool') -%}
| [{{ tool.tool }}]({{ tool.tool_url }}) | {{ tool.description }} |
{% endfor %}


## Bioconda Contributions

Bactopia requires tools be installable with Conda to simplify the installation process for
users. This requirement led to an unintended, but welcomed, deeper involvement involvement
with the Bioconda community. Bioconda is more than `conda install`, it is a valuable resource
that makes bioinformatics tools more accessible to the community. Every time a tool is added
to Bioconda, a Docker container is created by [Biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/),
as well as a Singularity image is created by the [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/).
In essence, a single recipe contributes significantly to the broader community.

Bactopia has led to  {{ conda_submissions | length }} new recipes, {{ conda_updates | length }}
updated recipes, and [more than 2,000 pull requests have been reviewed](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+involves%3Arpetit3+is%3Aclosed).

### New Recipes

Bactopia has led to the addition of {{ conda_submissions | length }} new recipes to
[Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).
These new recipes allow users to rapidly begin using these tools for their own analyses,
and include:

| Tool | Description | Pull Request  |
|------|-------------|---------------|
{% for submission in conda_submissions | sort(attribute='tool') -%}
| [{{ submission.tool }}]({{ submission.tool_url }}) | {{ submission.description }} | [{{ submission.pr_name }}]({{ submission.pr_url }}) |
{% endfor %}


!!! note "Every recipe gets a Docker and Singularity container"
    Sometimes overlooked, its important to reinterate, every recipe added to Bioconda has a 
    Docker container created by [Biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/), and a Singularity
    container created by the [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/). These containers 
    allow for version controlled reproducible analyses.

### Enhancements and Fixes

A common issue with Bioconda recipes, is the tool works great in a Conda environment when
containerized it fails for various reasons. When these issues occur with a tool used by
Bactopia an effort is made to improve or fix the Bioconda recipe. Below is a list fixes
and improvements to some Bioconda recipes:

| Tool | Description | Pull Request  |
|------|-------------|---------------|
{% for update in conda_updates -%}
| [{{ update.tool }}]({{ update.tool_url }}) | {{ update.title }} | [{{ update.pr_name }}]({{ update.pr_url }}) |
{% endfor %}

## nf-core/modules Contributions

When Bactopia transitioned to Nextflow DSL2, it opened the door to adopting modules
from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules). These modules enable users to
seamlessly integrate them in their own Nextflow DSL2 pipelines. To support this integration,
I decided to require each [Bactopia Tool](https://bactopia.github.io/bactopia-tools/), must
have a corresponding module be available from nf-core/modules. If such a module is not already
available, it will be added.

By adopting this practice, there have been {{ nfcore_modules | length }} contributions to
nf-core/modules in the form of new modules, module updates, and testing adjustments.

| Tool | Description | Pull Request  |
|------|-------------|---------------|
{% for nfcore_module in nfcore_modules -%}
| [{{ nfcore_module.tool }}]({{ nfcore_module.tool_url }}) | {{ nfcore_module.title }} | [{{ nfcore_module.pr_name }}]({{ nfcore_module.pr_url }}) |
{% endfor %}

## Other Contributions

In addition to Bioconda and nf-core/modules, Bactopia has made {{ other | length }} contributions to other tools including:

| Tool | Description | Pull Request  |
|------|-------------|---------------|
{% for tool in other -%}
| [{{ tool.tool }}]({{ tool.tool_url }}) | {{ tool.title }} | [{{ tool.pr_name }}]({{ tool.pr_url }}) |
{% endfor %}
