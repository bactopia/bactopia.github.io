# Acknowledgements

Bactopia is truly a case of *"standing upon the shoulders of giants"*. Bactopia
currently includes more than {{ total }} datasets and software packages. Nearly 
every component uses, from the workflow, datasets, software packages, even the 
framework for this site, was created by others and made freely available to the public.

I would like to personally extend my many thanks and gratitude to the authors
of these software packages and public datasets. If you've made it this far, I 
owe you a beer üçª (or coffee ‚òï!) if we ever encounter one another in person. 
Really, thank you very much!

!!! info "Please Cite Datasets and Tools"
    If you have used Bactopia in your work, please be sure to cite any datasets
    or software you may have used.

## Influences

### nf-core
[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) is group of great individuals volunteering 
their time to create a set of curated Nextflow analysis pipelines. The [nf-core Team](https://nf-co.re/about)
is putting together some amazing practices that I think really strengthen the 
Nextflow community as a whole!

Since the beginning I have always had the idea of Bactopia one day being 
apart of nf-core. Unfortunately, I think Bactopia is a much to big at this point to fit the nf-core mold, but that's OK! 
There are still many nf-core practices I've been able to adapt into Bactopia.

1. Arguement parsing based on nf-core library
2. All Bactopia Tools are adapted from nf-core/modules
3. Testing implemented to follow nf-core/modules

By implementing these practices, Bactopia I believe is much better pipeline to use. For this I'm very 
grateful to the nf-core community! Thank you!

## Public Datasets
Below is a list of {{ total_datasets }} public datasets that could have potentially 
been included during the *[Build Datasets](datasets.md)* step.

### Ariba Reference Datasets
These datasets are available using Ariba's `getref` function. You can learn 
more about this function at [Ariba's Wiki](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-getref).

{% for dataset in citations.datasets_ariba -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.datasets_ariba[dataset].name }}]({{ citations.datasets_ariba[dataset].link }})__   
{{ citations.datasets_ariba[dataset].cite }}  
{% endfor %}

### Minmer Datasets
{% for dataset in citations.datasets_minmer -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.datasets_minmer[dataset].name }}]({{ citations.datasets_minmer[dataset].link }})__   
{{ citations.datasets_minmer[dataset].cite }}  
{% endfor %}

### Everything Else

{% for dataset in citations.datasets_generic -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.datasets_generic[dataset].name }}]({{ citations.datasets_generic[dataset].link }})__   
{{ citations.datasets_generic[dataset].cite }}  
{% endfor %}

## Software Included In Bactopia
Below are {{ citations.tools | length }} of software packages used (directly and indirectly) by 
Bactopia. A link to the software page as well as the citation (if available) 
have been included.

{% for tool in citations.tools -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.tools[tool].name }}]({{ citations.tools[tool].link }})__  
{{ citations.tools[tool].description }}  
{{ citations.tools[tool].cite }}  
{% endfor %}
