# Acknowledgements

Bactopia is truly a case of *"standing upon the shoulders of giants"*. Bactopia
currently integrates more than {{ total }} datasets and software packages. Nearly
every component utilized in Bactopia, from the workflow to the datasets to the
software packages and even the framework of this site, was created by others
and made freely accessible to the public.

I would like to personally extend my many thanks and gratitude to the authors
of these software packages and public datasets. If you've made it this far, I 
owe you a beer üçª (or coffee ‚òï!) if we ever encounter one another in person. 
Really, thank you very much!

!!! info "Please Cite Datasets and Tools"
    If you have used Bactopia in your work, please be sure to cite any datasets
    or software you may have used.

## Funding

Support for this project came (in part) from an Emory Public Health Bioinformatics Fellowship
funded by the [CDC Emerging Infections Program (U50CK000485) PPHF/ACA: Enhancing Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity](https://dph.georgia.gov/EIP),
the [Wyoming Public Health Division](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/), and
the [Center for Applied Pathogen Epidemiology and Outbreak Control (CAPE)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/center-for-applied-pathogen-epidemiology-and-outbreak-control/).

## Influences

### nf-core
[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) is a great group of individuals volunteering their time to
create a set of curated Nextflow analysis pipelines. The [nf-core Team](https://nf-co.re/about)
has put together some amazing practices that I think really strengthen the Nextflow
community as a whole!

I'm often asked: _Will Bactopia ever be apart of nf-core?_

The answer is: _No, but..._

Bactopia, was adapted from Staphopia which pre-dates the beginnings of nf-core. As both nf-core
and Bactopia grew, it bacame clear adding Bactopia to nf-core was going to be a difficult
task. The last opporunity to do so was probably when Bactopia was converted to DSL2, but
Bactopia Tools would not likely ever fit into the nf-core mold. 

_However_, where possible, I have tried to implement nf-core practices into Bactopia.
Some examples include:

1. Arguement parsing based on nf-core library
2. All Bactopia Tools are adapted from nf-core/modules
3. Testing implemented to follow nf-core/modules

By implementing these practices, Bactopia I believe is much better pipeline to use. For
this I'm very grateful to the nf-core community! Thank you!

## Public Datasets
Below is a list of {{ total_datasets }} public datasets that could have potentially 
been used through Bactopia or Bactopia Tools.

### Ariba Reference Datasets
These datasets are available using Ariba's `getref` function. You can learn 
more about this function at [Ariba's Wiki](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-getref).

{% for dataset in citations.datasets_ariba -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.datasets_ariba[dataset].name }}]({{ citations.datasets_ariba[dataset].link }})__   
{{ citations.datasets_ariba[dataset].cite }}  
{% endfor %}

### Minmer Datasets
{% for dataset in citations.datasets_minmer -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.datasets_minmer[dataset].name }}]({{ citations.datasets_minmer[dataset].link }})__   
{{ citations.datasets_minmer[dataset].cite }}  
{% endfor %}

### Everything Else

{% for dataset in citations.datasets_generic -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.datasets_generic[dataset].name }}]({{ citations.datasets_generic[dataset].link }})__   
{{ citations.datasets_generic[dataset].cite }}  
{% endfor %}

## Software Included In Bactopia
Below are {{ citations.tools | length }} of software packages used (directly and indirectly) by 
Bactopia. A link to the software page as well as the citation (if available) 
have been included.

{% for tool in citations.tools -%}

{{ loop.index }}. __[{{ citations.tools[tool].name }}]({{ citations.tools[tool].link }})__  
{{ citations.tools[tool].description }}  
{{ citations.tools[tool].cite }}  
{% endfor %}
