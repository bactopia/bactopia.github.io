title: Bactopia - Ouput Overview
description: |
    A detailed description of all outputs produced by the main Bactopia pipeline
---
# Overview of Bactopia Output
After a successful run, Bactopia will have produced numerous output files. Just how many output files depends on the input datasets used (e.g. none, general datasets, species specific datasets, user populated datasets).

Here is the complete directory structure that is possible (using all available dataset options) with Bactopia. 

```
${SAMPLE_NAME}/
├── annotation
├── antimicrobial_resistance
├── ariba
├── assembly
├── blast
├── kmers
├── logs
├── mapping
├── minmers
├── mlst
├── quality-control
├── variants
└── ${SAMPLE_NAME}-genome-size.txt
```

For each type of analysis in Bactopia, a separate directory is created to hold the results. All samples processed by Bactopia will have this directory structure. The only difference is the usage of `${SAMPLE_NAME}` as a prefix for naming some output files.

## Directories
The following sections include a list of expected outputs as well as a brief description of each output file.

There are instances where additional files (e.g. `--keep_all_files` and `--ariba_noclean`) may be encountered. These files aren't described below, just the defaults. Also, using `--compress` will add a *gz* extension, but the original extension is maintained and its description still applies. 


!!! info "Developer Descriptions Take Priority"
    If a developer described their software's outputs, their description was used with a link back to the software's documentation (major thanks for taking the time to do that!). In some cases there may have been slight formatting modifications made. In any case, if descriptions are not original credit will be properly given to the source.

### `annotation`
The `annotation` directory will contain the outputs from [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) annotation. These outputs include FASTA (proteins and genes), GFF3, GenBank, and many more. By default the included Prokka databases are used for annotation. However, if a [Species Specific Dataset](/datasets/#species-specific) was a created the RefSeq clustered proteins are used first for annotation.

File descriptions were directly taken from [Prokka's Output Files](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka#output-files) section and slight modifications were made to the order of rows.

```

| .tbl | Feature Table file, used by "tbl2asn" to create the .sqn file. |
| .tsv | Tab-separated file of all features: locus_tag,ftype,len_bp,gene,EC_number,COG,product |

### `antimicrobial_resistance`
The `antimicrobial_resistance` directory will contain the output from [NCBI's AMRFinderPlus](https://github.com/ncbi/amr). The results of AMRFinderPlus using genes as and input, and proteins as an input are available. More information about the output format is available from the [AMRFinderPlus Wiki](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki/Running-AMRFinderPlus#output-format).

| Extension | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| -protein-report.txt | Results of using protein sequences as an input |

### `ariba`
The `ariba` directory will contain the results of any [Ariba](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/) analysis (excluding MLST). Only the [Ariba databases](/datasets/#general) created during the dataset setup are used for analysis. For each Ariba database (e.g. `card` or `vfdb`), a separate folder with the name of the database is included in the `ariba` folder.

The file descriptions below were modified from Ariba's wiki entries for [`run`](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-run) and [`summary`](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-summary).

### `assembly`
The `assembly` folder contains the results of the sample's assembly. 

#### standard
The standard assembly is managed by [Shovill](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) and by default [SKESA](https://github.com/ncbi/SKESA) is used for assembly. Alternative assemblers include [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades), [MEGAHIT](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit), and [Velvet](https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet). Depending on the choice of assembler, additional output files (e.g. assembly graphs) may be given.

Files descriptions with some modifications were directly taken from [Shovill's Output Files](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill#output-files) section as well as the [FLASH usage](https://sourceforge.net/p/flashpage/code/ci/master/tree/flash.c#l114).

    In the case where an assembly is given as an input, the only files that will be available are `${SAMPLE_NAME}.fna` (the original unmodified assembly) and `${SAMPLE_NAME}.fna.json`. If `--reassemble` is also given, then all the files seen above will be available.

#### hybrid
If long reads are available to supplement input paired-end Illumina reads, a hybrid assembly can be created using [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler).

Files descriptions with some modifications were directly taken from [Unicycler's Output Files](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler#output-files).

### `blast`
The `blast` directory contains the [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) results and a BLAST database of the sample assembly.

Each of the [User Populated BLAST Sequences](/datasets/#blast) (gene, primer, or protein) is BLASTed against the sample assembly. Also if [setup](/datasets/#general), annotated genes are BLASTed against the [PLSDB](https://ccb-microbe.cs.uni-saarland.de/plsdb/plasmids/download/) BLAST database.

By default, results are returned in tabular format.

```
${SAMPLE_NAME}/
└── blast

### `genome-size`
For every sample `${SAMPLE_NAME}-genome-size.txt` file is created. This file contains the genome size that was used for analysis. Genome size is used throughout Bactopia for various tasks including error correction, subsampling, and assembly.

By default, the genome size is estimated with Mash, but users have the option to provide their own value or completely disable genome size related features. Learn more about changing the genome size at [Basic Usage - Genome Size](/usage-basic/#-genome_size)

### `kmers`
The `kmers` directory contains [McCortex](https://github.com/mcveanlab/mccortex) 31-mer counts of the cleaned up FASTQ sequences. 

```

└── kmers
    └── ${SAMPLE_NAME}.ctx
```

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| .ctx      | A Cortex graph file of the 31-mer counts |

### `logs`
The `logs` folder will contain useful files for debugging or reviewing what was executed. For each process (e.g. annotation or assembly) the STDOUT and STDERR is log, as well as the time of execution and program versions. These outputs are completely optional, and can be disabled using `--skip_logs` at runtime.

```

Here is an example of the `bactopia.versions` file. 
```

# Bactopia Version
bactopia 1.4.11
# Nextflow Version

```

All the `.versions` files will follow this format. The first line is always `# Timestamp` followed by the output of `date`. Then each line beginning with `#` will represent a new program and its version. 


### `mapping`

For most organisms there is only one MLST schema available, and it will be labeled as `default`. In cases where a organism has multiple schemas available they will be named following pubMLST's naming.

```

### `quality-control`
The `quality-control` directory contains the cleaned up FASTQs ([BBTools](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) and [Lighter](https://github.com/mourisl/Lighter)) and summary statitics ([FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and [Fastq-Scan](https://github.com/rpetit3/fastq-scan)) before and after cleanup.

### `variants`
The `variants` directory contains the results of [Snippy](https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) variant calls against one or more reference genomes. There are two subdirectories `auto` and `user`. 

The `auto` directory includes variants calls against automatically selected reference genome(s) based on nearest Mash distance to RefSeq completed genomes. This process only happens if a [Species Specific Dataset](/datasets/#species-specific) was a created. By default, only a single reference genome (nearest) is selected. This feature can be disabled (`--disable_auto_variants`) or the number of genomes changed (`--max_references INT`).

The `user` directory contains variant calls against for each of the [User Populated Reference Genomes](/datasets/#reference-genomes).

The following description of files was directly taken from [Snippy's Output Files](https://github.com/tseemann/snippy#output-files) section. Slight modifications were made to the order of rows.
