please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm more than happy to assist and discuss further.

## Workshops

- _Workshop for using Bactopia (March 2023)_  
A workshop conducted with the [CDC Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch (EDLB)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/edlb/index.html), introducing
Bactopia and Bactopia Tools. This workshop provided a background on the many moving parts of Bactopia. Participants analyzed genomes with
Bactopia and used the Bactopia Tools to seamlessly expand their analyses. For this workshop we followed the steps provided by
[Bactopia Workshop](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia-workshop).
