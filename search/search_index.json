The process of downloading, building, and (or) configuring these datasets for Bactopia has been automated. Highly recommended to complete this step! This step is completely optional, but it is highly recommended that you do not. By skipping this step of setting up public datasets, Bactopia will be limited to analyses like quality control, assembly, and 31-mer counting. Included Datasets \u00b6 Some datasets included are applicable to all bacterial species and some are specific to a bacterial species. If specified at runtime, Bactopia will recognize the datasets and execute the appropriate analyses. General \u00b6 Ariba's getref Reference Datasets Allows reference datasets (resistance, virulence, and plamids) to be automatically downloaded and configured for usage by Ariba RefSeq Mash Sketch ~100,000 genomes and plasmids from NCBI RefSeq, used to give an idea of what is your sequencing data (e.g. Are the sequences what you expected?) GenBank Sourmash Signatures ~87,000 microbial genomes (includes viral and fungal) from NCBI GenBank, also gives an idea of what is your sequencing data. PLSDB Mash Sketch & BLAST Includes meta data/annotations, Mash sketches, and BLAST database files of all plasmids stored in PLSDB. Species Specific \u00b6 PubMLST.org MLST Schemas Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) allelic profiles and seqeunces for a many different bacterial species (and even a few eukaryotes!). Clustered RefSeq Proteins For the given bacterial species, completed RefSeq genomes are downloaded and then the proteins are clustered and formatted for usage with Prokka. Minmer Sketch of RefSeq Genomes Using the completed genomes downloaded for clustering proteins a Mash sketch and Sourmash signature is created for these genomes. These sketches can then be used for automatic selection of reference genomes for variant calling. Optional User Populated Folders A few folders for things such as calling variants, insertion sequences and primers are created that the user can manually populate. More information is available below! Setting Up \u00b6 Included in Bactopia is the setup-datasets.py script (located in the bin folder) to automate the process of downloading and/or building these datasets. Quick Start \u00b6 bactopia datasets datasets/ This will set up Ariba datasets ( card and vfdb_core ), RefSeq Mash sketch, GenBank Sourmash Signatures, and PLSDB in the newly created datasets folder. A Single Bacterial Species \u00b6 bactopia datasets datasets/ --species \"Haemophilus influenzae\" --include_genus Multiple Bacterial Species \u00b6 You can also set up datasets for multiple bacterial species at a time. There are two options to do so. Comma-Separated \u00b6 At runtime, you can separate the the different species bactopia datasets datasets/ --species \"Haemophilus influenzae,Staphylococcus aureus\" --include_genus Text File \u00b6 In order to do so, you will need to create a text file where each line is the name of a species to set up. For example, you could create a species.txt file and include the following species in it. Haemophilus influenzae Staphylococcus aureus Mycobacterium tuberculosis The new command becomes: bactopia datasets datasets/ --species species.txt --include_genus This will setup the MLST schema (if available) and a protein cluster FASTA file for each species in species.txt . Usage \u00b6 usage: bactopia datasets [-h] [--ariba STR] [--species STR] [--skip_prokka] [--include_genus] [--identity FLOAT] [--overlap FLOAT] [--max_memory INT] [--fast_cluster] [--skip_minmer] [--skip_plsdb] [--cpus INT] [--clear_cache] [--force] [--force_ariba] [--force_mlst] [--force_prokka] [--force_minmer] [--force_plsdb] [--keep_files] [--list_datasets] [--depends] [--version] [--verbose] [--silent] OUTPUT_DIRECTORY bactopia datasets - Setup public datasets for Bactopia positional arguments: OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Directory to write output. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit Ariba Reference Datasets: --ariba STR Setup Ariba datasets for a given reference or a list of references in a text file. (Default: card,vfdb_core) Bacterial Species: --species STR Download available (cg)MLST schemas and completed genomes for a given species or a list of species in a text file. Custom Prokka Protein FASTA: --skip_prokka Skip creation of a Prokka formatted fasta for each species --include_genus Include all genus members in the Prokka proteins FASTA --identity FLOAT CD-HIT (-c) sequence identity threshold. (Default: 0.9) --overlap FLOAT CD-HIT (-s) length difference cutoff. (Default: 0.8) --max_memory INT CD-HIT (-M) memory limit (in MB). (Default: unlimited --fast_cluster Use CD-HIT's (-g 0) fast clustering algorithm, instead of the accurate but slow algorithm. Minmer Datasets: --skip_minmer Skip download of pre-computed minmer datasets (mash, sourmash) PLSDB (Plasmid) BLAST/Sketch: --skip_plsdb Skip download of pre-computed PLSDB datbases (blast, mash) Helpful Options: --cpus INT Number of cpus to use. (Default: 1) --clear_cache Remove any existing cache. --force Forcibly overwrite existing datasets. --force_ariba Forcibly overwrite existing Ariba datasets. --force_mlst Forcibly overwrite existing MLST datasets. --force_prokka Forcibly overwrite existing Prokka datasets. --force_minmer Forcibly overwrite existing minmer datasets. --force_plsdb Forcibly overwrite existing PLSDB datasets. --keep_files Keep all downloaded and intermediate files. --list_datasets List Ariba reference datasets and (cg)MLST schemas available for setup. --depends Verify dependencies are installed. Adjust Verbosity: --version show program's version number and exit --verbose Print debug related text. --silent Only critical errors will be printed. example usage: setup-public-datasets.py outdir setup-public-datasets.py outdir --ariba 'card' setup-public-datasets.py outdir --species 'Staphylococcus aureus' --include_genus Useful Parameters \u00b6 --clear_cache \u00b6 To determine which MLST schemas are available, PubMLST.org is queryied. To prevent a query every run, a list of available schemas is cached to $HOME/.bactopia/datasets.json . The cache expires after 15 days, but in case a new species has been made available --clear_cache will force a requery of PubMLST.org. --cpus \u00b6 Increasing --cpus (it defaults to 1) is useful for speeding up the download and clustering steps. --force* \u00b6 If a dataset exists, it will only be overwritten if one of the --force parameters are used. --include_genus \u00b6 Completed RefSeq genomes are downloaded for a given species to be used for protein clustering. --include_genus will also download completed RefSeq genomes for each genus member. --keep_files \u00b6 Many intermediate files are downloaded/created (e.g. completed genomes) and deleted during the building process, use --keep_files to retain these files. Tweaking CD-HIT \u00b6 There are parameters ( --identity , --overlap , --max_memory , and --fast_cluster ) to tweak CD-HIT if you find it necessary. Please keep in mind, the only goal of the protein clustering step is to help speed up Prokka, by providing a decent set of proteins to annotate against first. User Populated Folders \u00b6 Built into the Bactopia dataset structure are folders that you, the user, can populate for species specific analysis. These could include specific genes you want BLASTed against your samples or a specific reference you want all your samples mapped to and variants called. Directory Structure \u00b6 When a species specific dataset is created, a folder named optional is also created. For example, a S. aureus specific dataset will have the following directory structure: datasets/species-specific/staphylococcus-aureus/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 annotation \u251c\u2500\u2500 minmer \u251c\u2500\u2500 mlst \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u251c\u2500\u2500 blast \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 genes \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 primers \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 proteins \u251c\u2500\u2500 insertion-sequences \u251c\u2500\u2500 mapping-sequences \u2514\u2500\u2500 reference-genomes Within the optional folder are folders that you can added your own data up interest to. BLAST \u00b6 datasets/species-specific/staphylococcus-aureus/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u2514\u2500\u2500 blast \u251c\u2500\u2500 genes \u251c\u2500\u2500 primers \u2514\u2500\u2500 proteins In the blast directory there are three more directories! The genes folder is where you can place gene seqeunces (nucleotides) in FASTA format to query against assemblies using blastn . The primers folder is where you can place primer sequences (nucleotides) in FASTA format to query against assemblies using blastn , but with primer-specific parameters and cut-offs. Finally, the proteins (as you probably guessed!) is where you can place protein sequnces (amino acids) in FASTA format to query against assemblies using blastp . Insertion Sequences \u00b6 datasets/species-specific/staphylococcus-aureus/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u2514\u2500\u2500 insertion-sequences In the insertion-sequences directory you can place FASTA files of insertion seqeunces you would like searched for using ISMapper . Mapping \u00b6 datasets/species-specific/staphylococcus-aureus/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u2514\u2500\u2500 mapping-sequences In the mapping-sequences directory you can place FASTA files of any nucleotide sequence you would like FASTQ reads to be mapped against using BWA . This can be useful if you are interested if whether a certain region or gene is covered or not. Reference Genomes \u00b6 datasets/species-specific/staphylococcus-aureus/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u2514\u2500\u2500 reference-genomes In the reference-genomes directory you can put a GenBank (preferred!) or FASTA file of a reference genome you would like variants to be called against using Snippy .","title":"Build Datasets"},{"location":"datasets/#build-datasets","text":"Bactopia can make use of many existing public datasets, as well as private datasets.

Directories \u00b6 The following sections include a list of expected outputs as well as a brief description of each output file. There are instances where additional files (e.g. --keep_all_files and --ariba_noclean ) may be encountered. These files aren't described below, just the defaults. Also, using --compress will add a gz extension, but the original extension is maintained and its description still applies. Developer Descriptions Take Priority If a developer described their software's outputs, their description was used with a link back to the software's documentation (major thanks for taking the time to do that!). In some cases there may have been slight formatting modifications made. In any case, if descriptions are not original credit will be properly given to the source. annotation \u00b6 The annotation directory will contain the outputs from Prokka annotation. These outputs include FASTA (proteins and genes), GFF3, GenBank, and many more. By default the included Prokka databases are used for annotation. However, if a Species Specific Dataset was a created the RefSeq clustered proteins are used first for annotation.

We will use S. aureus samples associated with cystic fibrosis lung infections that were recently published (details below, shameless self plug!) and are available from BioProject accession PRJNA480016 . Bernardy, Eryn E., et al. \"Whole-Genome Sequences of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates from Cystic Fibrosis Lung Infections.\" Microbiol Resour Announc 8.3 (2019): e01564-18. Overall the goal of the tutorial is to: Build datasets Acquire Staphopia datasets Use Bactopia to process: A sample from SRA/ENA Multiple samples from SRA/ENA Single local sample Multiple local samples using FOFN Bactopia Should Be Installed This tutorial assumes you have already installed Bactopia. If you have not, please check out how to at Installation . Build Datasets \u00b6 First let's create a directory to work in and activate our Bactopia environment. mkdir bactopia-tutorial cd bactopia-tutorial conda activate bactopia Now we are ready to build our datasets! bactopia datasets datasets/ --ariba \"vfdb_core,card\" \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --include_genus \\ --cpus 4 Let's review what is happening here. datasets/ is where our datasets will be downloaded, processed and stored. --ariba \"vfdb_core,card\" says to download and setup the VFDB Core and the CARD databases to be used by Ariba. --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" will download MLST schemas associated with S. aureus it will also download completed S. aureus genomes (RefSeq only) that are used to create a set of protein set for annotation, a Mash sketch for automatic variant calling to the nearest neighbor, and calulate genome size statistics. --include_genus will also download completed genomes from the Staphylococcus genus that will be used for the protein set. These completed genomes are not used for the sketch creation or genome size calculation. --cpus 4 will use 4 cpus for downloading and the clustering step. Adjust this number according to your setup! Use CARD over MEGARes Staphopia v1 made use of MEGARes, for the purposes of this tutorial we are going to use the CARD database instead. If all goes well, the newly created datasets are now available in the folder datasets/ . We have now completed the dataset creation step! Pat yourself on the back! Next we'll supplement these datasets with some optional S. aureus specific datasets. Acquire Staphopia Datasets \u00b6 Staphopia includes a few optional datasets such as S. aureus N315 reference genome and SCCmec sequences (primers, proteins, full cassettes). We will acquire these files using the Bactopia Datasets GitHub repository. For this tutorial a Staphopia v1 branch has been created, which includes this optional dataset. Now let's clone the repository. git clone -b staphopia-v1 https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia-datasets.git Next we'll copy the files into our recently built datasets folder and delete the bactopia-datasets repository since we no longer need it. cp -r bactopia-datasets/species-specific/ datasets/ rm -rf bactopia-datasets/ ~Voil\u00e0! That should be it. You should now have the Staphopia v1 datasets included with your recentely built datasets (e.g. S. aureus protein clusters, RefSeq sketch, etc...) Running Bactopia \u00b6 OK! Get your servers started up! It is time to get processing! Samples on SRA \u00b6 Single Sample \u00b6 Let's start this by downloading a single sample from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and processing it through Bactopia. bactopia --accession SRX4563634 \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir ena-single-sample So, what's happening here? --accession SRX4563634 is telling Bactopia to download FASTQs associated with Exeriment accession SRX4563634. --datasets datasets/ tells Bactopia your pre-built datasets are in the folder datasets . --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" tells Bactopia, within the datasets folder, use the species specific dataset for S. aureus . --coverage 100 will limit the cleaned up FASTQ file to an estimated 100x coverage based on the genome size. --genome_size median tells Bactopia to use the median genome size of completed S. aureus genomes. The minimum, maximum, median, and mean genome sizes were calculated during the dataset building step. If a genome size was not given, it would have been estimated by Mash. --cpus 2 tells Bactopia to use a maximum of 2 cpus per process. Adjust this parameter to fit your setup! --outdir ena-single-sample tells Bactopia to dump the results into the ena-single-sample folder. Please keep in mind, this will not stop Nextflow from creating files (.nextflow, trace.txt, etc...) and directories (work and .nextflow/) within your current directory. Use --use_ena to download from ENA If you append --use_ena to the command above the FASTQ files for SRX4563634 will be downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) instead of SRA. Once you launch this command, sit back, relax and watch the Nextflow give realtime updates for SRX4563634's analysis! The approximate completion time is ~15-30 minutes depending on the number of cpus given and download times from ENA. Once complete, the results from numerous tools available to you in ena-single-sample/SRX4563634/ . Multiple Samples \u00b6 Now we are going to have Bactopia download and process 5 samples from ENA. To do this we can use the bactopia search function. bactopia search PRJNA480016 --limit 5 This will produce three files: ena-accessions.txt , ena-results.txt and ena-summary.txt . To learn more about these files see Generating Accession List . For this tutorial, ena-accessions.txt is the file we need. It contains five Experiment accessions, a single one per line. Just like this: SRX4563688 SRX4563687 SRX4563686 SRX4563689 SRX4563690 Note: you may have 5 different accessions from the PRJNA480016 project. To process these samples, we will adjust our command used previously. bactopia --accessions ena-accessions.txt \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir ena-multiple-samples Instead of --accession we are now using --accessions ena-accessions.txt which tells Bactopia to read ena-accessions.txt , and download each Experiment accession from SRA (for ENA add --use_ena ) and then process it. At this point, you might want to go for a walk or make yourself a coffee! This step has an approximate completion time of ~45-120 minutes , which again is fully dependent on the cpus used and the download times from SRA (or ENA). Once this is complete, the results for all five samples will be found in the ena-multiple-samples directory. Each sample will have there own folder of results. Local Samples \u00b6 So for the local samples, we're going to recycle some of the samples we downloaded from SRA/ENA. First let's make a directory to put the FASTQs into: mkdir fastqs Now let's move some the FASTQs from our SRX4563634 sample into this folder. cp ena-single-sample/SRX4563634/quality-control/SRX4563634*.fastq.gz fastqs/ Finally let's also make a single-end version of SRX4563634. cat fastqs/SRX4563634*.fastq.gz > fastqs/SRX4563634-SE.fastq.gz OK! Now we are ready to continue the tutorial! Single Sample \u00b6 Again we'll mostly be using the same parameters as previous, but with a few new ones. To process a single sample you can use the --R1 / --R2 (paired-end), --SE (single-end), and --sample parameters. Paired-End \u00b6 For paired-end reads you will want to use --R1 , --R2 , and --sample . For this paired-end example we'll use SRX4563634 again which we've copied to the fastqs folder. bactopia --R1 fastqs/SRX4563634_R1.fastq.gz \\ --R2 fastqs/SRX4563634_R2.fastq.gz \\ --sample SRX4563634 \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir local-single-sample Now Bactopia will recognize the --R1 and --R2 parameters as paired-end reads and process. The --sample is required and will be used for naming the output. Similar to the single SRA/ENA sample, the approximate completion time is ~15-30 minutes depending on the number of cpus given. Once complete, results can be found in local-single-sample/SRX4563634/ . Single-End \u00b6 In the case of Illumina reads, you're very unlikely to produce single-end reads, but they do exist in the wild (early days of Illumina!). Nevertheless, because single-end reads do exist, single-end support was built into Bactopia. To analyze single-end reads, the --SE parameter will replace --R1 and --R2 . bactopia --SE fastqs/SRX4563634-SE.fastq.gz \\ --sample SRX4563634-SE \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir local-single-sample Now SRX4563634-SE will be processed as a single-end sample. For single-end processing there are some paired-end only analyses (e.g. error correction, insertion sequences) that will be skipped. This leads to single-end samples being processed a little bit faster than pair-end samples. But, the approximate completion time is still ~15-30 minutes . Once complete, you'll the results from numerous tools available to you in local-single-sample/SRX4563634-SE/ . If you made it this far, you're almost done! Multiple Samples (FOFN) \u00b6 Here we go! The final way you can process samples in Bactopia! Bactopia allows you to give a text file describing the input samples. This file of file names (FOFN), contains sample names and location to associated FASTQs. The Bactopia FOFN format is described in detail at Basic Usage -> Multiple Samples . First we'll need to prepare a FOFN describing the FASTQ files in our fastqs folder. We can use bactopia prepare to do so: bactopia prepare fastqs/ > fastqs.txt This command will try to create a FOFN for you. For this turorial, the FASTQ names are pretty straight forward and should produce a correct FOFN (or at least it should! ... hopefully!). If that wasn't the case for you, there are ways to tweak bactopia prepare . Now we can use the --fastqs parameters to process samples in the FOFN. bactopia --fastqs fastqs.txt \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir local-multiple-samples We no longer need --R1 , --R2 , --SE , or --sample as the values for these parameters can be determined from the FOFN.

Only useful on new installs of Bactopia. --version Print workflow version information --help Show this message and exit --help_all Show a complete list of adjustable parameters FASTQ Inputs \u00b6 Bactopia has multiple approaches to specify your input sequences. You can make use of your local FASTQs or download FASTQs from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) . Which approach really depends on what you need to achieve! The following sections describe methods to process single samples, multiple samples, downloading samples from the ENA. Local \u00b6 Single Sample \u00b6 When you only need to process a single sample at a time, Bactopia allows that! You only have to the sample name ( --sample ) and the whether the read set is paired-end ( --R1 and --R2 ) or a single-end ( --SE ). Use --R1, --R2 for Paired-End FASTQs bactopia --sample my-sample --R1 /path/to/my-sample_R1.fastq.gz --R2 /path/to/my-sample_R2.fastq.gz Use --SE for Single-End FASTQs bactopia --sample my-sample --SE /path/to/my-sample.fastq.gz Multiple Samples \u00b6 For multiple samples, you must create a file with information about the inputs, a file of filenames (FOFN). This file specifies sample names and location of FASTQs to be processed. Using this information, paired-end or single-end information can be extracted as well as naming output files. While this is an additional step for you, the user, it helps to avoid potential pattern matching errors. Most importantly, by taking this approach, you can process hundreds of samples in a single command. There is also the added benefit of knowing which FASTQs were analysed and their location at a later time! Use --fastqs for Multiple Samples bactopia --fastqs my-samples.txt The FOFN Format \u00b6 You can use the --example_fastqs to get an example of the expected structure for the input FASTQs FOFN. bactopia --example_fastqs N E X T F L O W ~ version 19.01.0 Launching `/home/rpetit/illumina-cleanup/bin/illumina-cleanup` [naughty_borg] - revision: 0416ba407c Printing example input for \"--fastqs\" sample r1 r2 test001 /path/to/fastqs/test_R1.fastq.gz /path/to/fastqs/test_R2.fastq.gz test002 /path/to/fastqs/test.fastq.gz The expected structure is a tab-delimited table with three columns: sample : A unique prefix, or unique name, to be used for naming output files r1 : If paired-end, the first pair of reads, else the single-end reads r2 : If paired-end, the second pair of reads These three columns are used as the header for the file. In other words, all input FOFNs require their first line to be: sample r1 r2 All lines after the header line, contain unique sample names and location(s) to associated FASTQ file(s). Absolute paths should be used to prevent any file not found errors due to the relative path changing. In the example above, two samples would be processed by Bactopia. Sample test001 has two FASTQs and would be processed as pair-end reads. While sample test002 only has a single FASTQ and would be processed as single-end reads. Generating A FOFN \u00b6 bactopia prepare has been included to help aid (hopefully!) the process of creating a FOFN for your samples. This script will attempt to find FASTQ files in a given directory and output the expected FOFN format. It will also output any potential issues associated with the pattern matching. Verify accuracy of FOFN This is currently an experimental function. There are likely bugs to be ironed out. Please be sure to give the resulting FOFN a quick look over.

Just please be sure to give a quick look over of the resulting FOFN. Validating FOFN \u00b6 When a FOFN is given, the first thing Bactopia does is verify all FASTQ files are found. If everything checks out, each sample will then be processed, otherwise a list of samples with errors will be output to STDERR. If you would like to only validate your FOFN (and not run the full pipeline), you can use the --check_fastqs parameter.

Bactopia will then query ENA to determine Run accession(s) associated with the given Experiment accession and proceed download the corresponding FASTQ files from either the SRA (default) or ENA ( --use_ena ). After the download is completed, it will be processed through Bactopia. Use --accession for a Single Experiment Accession SRA: bactopia --accession SRX476958 ENA: bactopia --accession SRX476958 --use_ena Use --accessions for Multiple Experiment Accessions SRA: bactopia --accessions my-accessions.txt ENA: bactopia --accessions my-accessions.txt --use_ena Generating Accession List \u00b6 bactopia search has been made to help assist in generating a list of Experiment accessions to be procesed by Bactopia (via --accessions ). Users can provide a Taxon ID (e.g. 1280), a binary name (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), or Study accessions (e.g. PRJNA480016). This value is then queried against ENA's Data Warehouse API ), and a list of all Experiment accessions associated with the query is returned.

By default, a genome size is estimated using Mash. However, users can provide their own value for genome size, use values based on Species Specific Datasets , or completely disable it. Value Result empty Mash is used to estimate the genome size integer Uses the genome size (e.g. --genome_size 2800000 ) provided by the user 0 Read error correct and read subsampling will be disabled. min Requires --species , the minimum completed genome size for a species is used median Requires --species , the median completed genome size for a species is used mean Requires --species , the mean completed genome size for a species is used max Requires --species , the maximum completed genome size for a species is used Mash may not be the most accurate estimate Mash is very convenient to quickly estimate a genome size, but it may not be the most accurate in all cases and will differ between samples. It is recommended that when possible a known genome size or one based off completed genomes should be used. --keep_all_files \u00b6 In some processes, Bactopia will delete large intermediate files (e.g. multiple uncompressed FASTQs) only after a process successfully completes. Since this a per-process function, it does not affect Nextflow's ability to resume ( -resume )a workflow. You can deactivate this feature using --keep_all_files .

Through out the workflow there are steps that are always enabled and dataset enabled . Each of the steps depicted in the image below are described in this section. A list of software directly used in each step is also listed. Please check out the Acknowledgements section to get the full list of software as well how to download and cite said software. Always Enabled Steps \u00b6 The Always Enabled Steps are always executed by Bactopia. These steps do not depend of external datasets and thus are always enabled. Gather FASTQs \u00b6 Specifies exactly where the input FASTQs are coming from. If you are using local inputs (e.g. --R1/--R2 , --fastqs ) it will verify they can be accessed. If ENA/SRA accessions ( --accession or --accessions ) were given, they corresponding FASTQs are downloaded in this step. Software Usage ena-dl Download FASTQ files from ENA Validate FASTQs \u00b6 Determines if the FASTQ file contains enough sequencing to continue processing. The --min_reads and --min_basepairs parameters adjust the minimum amount of sequencing required to continue processing. This step does not directly test the validity of the FASTQ format (although, it would fail if the format is invalid!). Software Usage fastq-scan Determine total read and basepairs of FASTQ Original Summary \u00b6 Produces summary statistics (read lengths, quality scores, etc...) based on the original input FASTQs. Software Usage FastQC Generates a HTML report of original FASTQ summary statistics fastq-scan Generates original FASTQ summary statistics in JSON format Genome Size \u00b6 The genome size is by various programs in the Bactopia workflow. By default, if no genome size is given one is estimated using Mash. Otherwise, a specific genome size can be specified or completely disabled using the --genome_size parameter. See Genome Size Parameter to learn more about specifying the genome size. Software Usage Mash If not given, estimates genome size of sample Quality Control \u00b6 The input FASTQs go through a few clean up steps. First, Illumina related adapters and phiX contaminants are removed. Then reads that fail to pass length and/or quality requirements are filtered out. If the genome size is available, sequence error-corrections are made and the total sequencing is reduced to a specified coverage. After this step, all downstream analyses are based on the QC'd FASTQ and the original is no longer used. Software Description BBTools Removes Illumina adapters, phiX contaminants, filters reads based on length and quality score, and reduces inputs to a specified coverage. Lighter Corrects sequencing errors QC Summary \u00b6 Produces summary statistics (read lengths, quality scores, etc...) based on the final set of QC'd FASTQs. Software Usage FastQC Generates a HTML report of QC'd FASTQ summary statistics fastq-scan Generates QC'd FASTQ summary statistics in JSON format Count 31-mers \u00b6 All 31 basepair (31-mers) sequences are counted and the singletons (those 31-mers only counted once) are filtered out. Software Description McCortex Counts 31-mers in the input FASTQ Minmer Sketch \u00b6 A minmer sketch and signature is created based on the QC'd FASTQs for multiple values of k . If datasets are available, the sketches/signatures are used for further downstream analysis. Software Usage Mash Produces a sketch ( k =21,31) of tje QC'd FASTQ Sourmash Produces a signature ( k =21,31,51) of the QC'd FASTQ De novo Assembly \u00b6 The QC'd FASTQs are assembled using the Shovill pipeline. This allows for a seamless assembly process using MEGAHIT , SKESA , SPAdes or Velvet . Software Usage assembly-scan Generates summary statistics of the final assembly Shovill Manages multiple steps in the Illumina assembly process Genome Annotation \u00b6 Genes are predicted and annotated from the assembled genome using Prokka . If available, a clustered RefSeq protein set is used for the first pass of annotation. Software Usage Prokka Predicts and annotates assembled genomes Antimicrobial Resistance \u00b6 Searches for antimicrobial resistance genes and assosiated point mutations in the annotated gene and protein sequences. If datasets are available, local assemblies can also be used to predict antibiotic resistance. Software Usage AMRFinderPlus Predicts antimicrobial resistance based on genes and point mutations Dataset Enabled Steps \u00b6 The remaining Dataset Enabled Steps require supplemental datasets to be available to be executed. There are many datasets available that Bactopia can take advantage of. To learn more about setting up these datasets, check out Build Datasets . These datasets can be broken into two groups, Public Datasets and User Datasets . Public Datasets \u00b6 Publicly available datasets can be used for futher analysis. Call Variants (Auto) \u00b6 Variants are predicted using Snippy . The QC'd FASTQs are aligned to the nearest (based on Mash distance) RefSeq completed genome. By default, only the nearest genome is selected, but multiple genomes can be selected ( --max_references ) or this feature can be completely disabled ( disable_auto_variants ). Software Usage Bedtools Generates the per-base coverage of the reference alignment NCBI Genome Download Downloads the RefSeq completed genome Snippy Manages multiple steps in the haploid variant calling process vcf-annotator Adds annotations from reference GenBank to the final VCF Local Assembly \u00b6 Using available Ariba reference datasets , determines which reference sequences were found with an additional detailed report summarizing the results. Software Usage Ariba Creates local assemblies of reference sequences Minmer Query \u00b6 Screens QC'd FASTQs and signatures against available Minmer Datasets . Software Usage Mash Screens against RefSeq and/or PLSDB sketches Sourmash Screens signature against GenBank Sequence Type \u00b6 Uses a PubMLST.org MLST schema to determine the sequence type of the sample. Software Usage Ariba Runs QC'd FASTQ against a MLST database BLAST Aligns MLST loci against the assembled genome User Datasets \u00b6 Another option is for users to provide their own data to include in the analysis. BLAST Alignment \u00b6 Each gene, protein, or primer sequence provided by the user is aligned against the assembled genome. Software Usage BLAST Aligns reference sequences against the assembled genome Call Variants (User) \u00b6 Uses the same procedure as Call Variants (Auto) , except variants are called against each reference provided by the user.
