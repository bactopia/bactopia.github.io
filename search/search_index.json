(2015)","title":"Software Included In Bactopia"},{"location":"datasets/","text":"Build Datasets \u00b6 Bactopia can make use of many existing public datasets, as well as private datasets. The process of downloading, building, and (or) configuring these datasets for Bactopia has been automated. Highly recommended to complete this step! This step is completely optional, but it is highly recommended that you do not. By skipping this step of setting up public datasets, Bactopia will be limited to analyses like quality control, assembly, and 31-mer counting. Included Datasets \u00b6 Some datasets included are applicable to all bacterial species and some are specific to a bacterial species. If specified at runtime, Bactopia will recognize the datasets and execute the appropriate analyses. General \u00b6 Ariba's getref Reference Datasets Allows reference datasets (resistance, virulence, and plamids) to be automatically downloaded and configured for usage by Ariba RefSeq Mash Sketch ~100,000 genomes and plasmids from NCBI RefSeq, used to give an idea of what is your sequencing data (e.g. Are the sequences what you expected?) GenBank Sourmash Signatures ~87,000 microbial genomes (includes viral and fungal) from NCBI GenBank, also gives an idea of what is your sequencing data. PLSDB Mash Sketch & BLAST Includes meta data/annotations, Mash sketches, and BLAST database files of all plasmids stored in PLSDB. Species Specific \u00b6 PubMLST.org MLST Schemas Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) allelic profiles and seqeunces for a many different bacterial species (and even a few eukaryotes!). Clustered RefSeq Proteins For the given bacterial species, completed RefSeq genomes are downloaded and then the proteins are clustered and formatted for usage with Prokka. Minmer Sketch of RefSeq Genomes Using the completed genomes downloaded for clustering proteins a Mash sketch and Sourmash signature is created for these genomes. These sketches can then be used for automatic selection of reference genomes for variant calling. Optional User Populated Folders A few folders for things such as calling variants, insertion sequences and primers are created that the user can manually populate. More information is available below! Setting Up \u00b6 Included in Bactopia is the setup-datasets.py script (located in the bin folder) to automate the process of downloading and/or building these datasets. Quick Start \u00b6 bactopia datasets datasets/ This will set up Ariba datasets ( card and vfdb_core ), RefSeq Mash sketch, GenBank Sourmash Signatures, and PLSDB in the newly created datasets folder. A Single Bacterial Species \u00b6 bactopia datasets datasets/ --species \"Haemophilus influenzae\" --include_genus Multiple Bacterial Species \u00b6 You can also set up datasets for multiple bacterial species at a time. There are two options to do so. Comma-Separated \u00b6 At runtime, you can separate the the different species bactopia datasets datasets/ --species \"Haemophilus influenzae,Staphylococcus aureus\" --include_genus Text File \u00b6 In order to do so, you will need to create a text file where each line is the name of a species to set up. For example, you could create a species.txt file and include the following species in it. Haemophilus influenzae Staphylococcus aureus Mycobacterium tuberculosis The new command becomes: bactopia datasets datasets/ --species species.txt --include_genus This will setup the MLST schema (if available) and a protein cluster FASTA file for each species in species.txt . Usage \u00b6 usage: bactopia datasets [-h] [--ariba STR] [--species STR] [--skip_prokka] [--include_genus] [--limit INT] [--accessions STR] [--identity FLOAT] [--overlap FLOAT] [--max_memory INT] [--fast_cluster] [--skip_minmer] [--skip_plsdb] [--cpus INT] [--clear_cache] [--force] [--force_ariba] [--force_mlst] [--force_prokka] [--force_minmer] [--force_plsdb] [--keep_files] [--list_datasets] [--depends] [--version] [--verbose] [--silent] OUTPUT_DIRECTORY bactopia datasets - Setup public datasets for Bactopia positional arguments: OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Directory to write output. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit Ariba Reference Datasets: --ariba STR Setup Ariba datasets for a given reference or a list of references in a text file. (Default: card,vfdb_core) Bacterial Species: --species STR Download available (cg)MLST schemas and completed genomes for a given species or a list of species in a text file. Custom Prokka Protein FASTA: --skip_prokka Skip creation of a Prokka formatted fasta for each species --include_genus Include all genus members in the Prokka proteins FASTA --limit INT If available completed genomes exceeds a given limit, a random subsample will be taken. --accessions STR A list of RefSeq accessions to download. --identity FLOAT CD-HIT (-c) sequence identity threshold. (Default: 0.9) --overlap FLOAT CD-HIT (-s) length difference cutoff. (Default: 0.8) --max_memory INT CD-HIT (-M) memory limit (in MB). (Default: unlimited --fast_cluster Use CD-HIT's (-g 0) fast clustering algorithm, instead of the accurate but slow algorithm. Minmer Datasets: --skip_minmer Skip download of pre-computed minmer datasets (mash, sourmash) PLSDB (Plasmid) BLAST/Sketch: --skip_plsdb Skip download of pre-computed PLSDB datbases (blast, mash) Helpful Options: --cpus INT Number of cpus to use. (Default: 1) --clear_cache Remove any existing cache. --force Forcibly overwrite existing datasets. --force_ariba Forcibly overwrite existing Ariba datasets. --force_mlst Forcibly overwrite existing MLST datasets. --force_prokka Forcibly overwrite existing Prokka datasets. --force_minmer Forcibly overwrite existing minmer datasets. --force_plsdb Forcibly overwrite existing PLSDB datasets. --keep_files Keep all downloaded and intermediate files. --list_datasets List Ariba reference datasets and (cg)MLST schemas available for setup. --depends Verify dependencies are installed. Adjust Verbosity: --version show program's version number and exit --verbose Print debug related text. --silent Only critical errors will be printed. example usage: setup-public-datasets.py outdir setup-public-datasets.py outdir --ariba 'card' setup-public-datasets.py outdir --species 'Staphylococcus aureus' --include_genus Useful Parameters \u00b6 --clear_cache \u00b6 To determine which MLST schemas are available, PubMLST.org is queryied. To prevent a query every run, a list of available schemas is cached to $HOME/.bactopia/datasets.json . The cache expires after 15 days, but in case a new species has been made available --clear_cache will force a requery of PubMLST.org. --cpus \u00b6 Increasing --cpus (it defaults to 1) is useful for speeding up the download and clustering steps. --force* \u00b6 If a dataset exists, it will only be overwritten if one of the --force parameters are used. --include_genus \u00b6 Completed RefSeq genomes are downloaded for a given species to be used for protein clustering. --include_genus will also download completed RefSeq genomes for each genus member. --limit \u00b6 For some species of bacteria there might be thousands of completed genomes available. For dataset creation, downloading thousands of completed genomes will be time consuming and like take up a significant amount of storage. To help in such cases --limit can be used to limit the downloads to a random subset of genomes. --accessions \u00b6 In cases where a random subset of completed genomes is not ideal, you can provide your own curated list of genomes to download with --accessions . The file should have a single NCBI RefSeq Assembly accession (E.g GCF_000008865.2) per line. --keep_files \u00b6 Many intermediate files are downloaded/created (e.g. completed genomes) and deleted during the building process, use --keep_files to retain these files. Tweaking CD-HIT \u00b6 There are parameters ( --identity , --overlap , --max_memory , and --fast_cluster ) to tweak CD-HIT if you find it necessary. Please keep in mind, the only goal of the protein clustering step is to help speed up Prokka, by providing a decent set of proteins to annotate against first. Datasets Folder Overview \u00b6 After creating datasets you will have a directory structure that Bactopia recognizes. Based on the available datasets Bactopia will queue up the associated analyses. Here is the directory structure for the Bactopia Datasets. Some of these include files from public datasets that can be used directly, but there are also other folders you can populate yourself to fit your needs. ${DATASET_FOLDER} \u251c\u2500\u2500 ariba \u251c\u2500\u2500 minmer \u251c\u2500\u2500 plasmid \u2514\u2500\u2500 species-specific \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SPECIES} \u251c\u2500\u2500 annotation \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cdhit-stats.txt \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 genome_size.json \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ncbi-metadata.txt \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 proteins.faa \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 proteins.faa.clstr \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 proteins-updated.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 minmer \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 minmer-updated.txt \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 refseq-genomes.msh \u251c\u2500\u2500 mlst \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SCHEMA} \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ariba.tar.gz \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blastdb.tar.gz \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 mlst-updated.txt \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u251c\u2500\u2500 blast \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 genes \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 primers \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 proteins \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u251c\u2500\u2500 insertion-sequences \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u251c\u2500\u2500 mapping-sequences \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u2514\u2500\u2500 reference-genomes \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.{gbk|fasta} General Datasets \u00b6 General datasets can be used for all bacterial samples. There are three general dataset folders: ariba , minmer and plasmid . The ariba folder contains pre-formatted datasets available from Ariba's getref Reference Datasets . The minmer folder contains a RefSeq Mash Sketch and GenBank Sourmash Signatures of more than 100,000 genomes. Finally, the plasmid folder contains a PLSDB Mash Sketch & BLAST database from a curated set of plasmids. Changing files in ariba , minmer and plasmid is not recommended These directories are for general analysis and have been precomputed. Modifying these files may cause errors during analysis. Species Specific Datasets \u00b6 Bactopia allows the datasets to be created for a specific species. The following sections outline the species specific datasets. annotation \u00b6 Completed RefSeq genomes are downloaded and then the proteins are clustered and formatted for usage with Prokka. The results from this clustering is stored in the annotation folder. ${DATASET_FOLDER} \u2514\u2500\u2500 species-specific \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SPECIES} \u2514\u2500\u2500 annotation \u251c\u2500\u2500 cdhit-stats.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 genome_size.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 ncbi-metadata.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 proteins.faa \u251c\u2500\u2500 proteins.faa.clstr \u2514\u2500\u2500 proteins-updated.txt Filename Description cdhit-stats.txt General statistics associated with CD-HIT clustering genome_size.json A list of genome size for each downloaded RefSeq genome ncbi-metadata.txt NCBI Assembly metadata associated with the downloaded RefSeq genomes proteins.faa Set of Prokka formatted proteins proteins.faa.clstr Description of the clusters created by CD-HIT proteins-updated.txt Information on the last time the protein set was updated You can add your curated protein set here If you have a set of proteins you would like to use for annotation, you can name it proteins.faa and place it in the annotation folder. In order for your set of proteins to be used by Prokka, you must make sure you follow the Prokka FASTA database format . An alternative is to use the --accessions parameter and give bactopia datasets the list of RefSeq accessions when the dataset is created. In doing so the custom protein set will be automatically formatted using the genomes you specified. minmer \u00b6 By default, a Mash sketch is created for the completed genomes downloaded for clustering proteins. These sketches are then be used for automatic selection of reference genomes for variant calling. ${DATASET_FOLDER} \u2514\u2500\u2500 species-specific \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SPECIES} \u2514\u2500\u2500 minmer \u251c\u2500\u2500 minmer-updated.txt \u2514\u2500\u2500 refseq-genomes.msh | Filename | Description | |----------|-------------| | minmer-updated.txt | Information on the last time the mash sketch was updated | | refseq-genomes.msh | A Mash sketch (k=31) of the RefSeq completed genomes | You can add your curated RefSeq sketch here You can replace refseq-genomes.msh with a custom set of RefSeq genomes to be used for automatic reference selection. The only requirements to do so are that only RefSeq genomes (start with GCF) are used and the mash sketch uses a k-mer length of 31 ( -k 31 ). This will allow it to be compatible with Bactopia. An alternative is to use the --accessions parameter and give bactopia datasets the list of RefSeq accessions when the dataset is created. In doing so the mash sketch will be automatically created. mlst \u00b6 The mlst folder contains MLST schemas that have been formatted to be used by Ariba and BLAST . ${DATASET_FOLDER} \u2514\u2500\u2500 species-specific \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SPECIES} \u2514\u2500\u2500 mlst \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SCHEMA} \u251c\u2500\u2500 ariba.tar.gz \u251c\u2500\u2500 blastdb.tar.gz \u2514\u2500\u2500 mlst-updated.txt Filename Description ariba.tar.gz An Ariba formatted MLST dataset for a given schema blastdb.tar.gz A BLAST formatted MLST dataset for a given schema mlst-updated.txt Contains time stamp for the last time the MSLT dataset was updated How does Bactopia handle organisms with multiple MLST schemas? In a few cases, an organism might have multiple MLST schemas available (Example: E. coli ). In such cases, each MLST schema is downloaded and set up. Bactopia will also call sequence types against each schema. Changing files in mlst is not recommended The MLST schemas have been pre-formatted for your usage. There might be rare cases where you would like to provide your own schema. If this is the case it is recommended you take a look at: What about MLST not hosted at pubmlst.org? then follow the directory structure for mlst . optional \u00b6 Built into the Bactopia dataset structure is the optional folder that you, the user, can populate for species specific analysis. These could include specific genes you might want BLASTed against your samples or a specific reference you want all your samples mapped to and variants called. blast \u00b6 ${DATASET_FOLDER} \u2514\u2500\u2500 species-specific \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${SPECIES} \u2514\u2500\u2500 optional \u2514\u2500\u2500 blast \u251c\u2500\u2500 genes \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u251c\u2500\u2500 primers \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta \u2514\u2500\u2500 proteins \u2514\u2500\u2500 ${NAME}.fasta In the blast directory there are three more directories!

Directories \u00b6 The following sections include a list of expected outputs as well as a brief description of each output file. There are instances where additional files (e.g. --keep_all_files and --ariba_noclean ) may be encountered. These files aren't described below, just the defaults. Also, using --compress will add a gz extension, but the original extension is maintained and its description still applies. Developer Descriptions Take Priority If a developer described their software's outputs, their description was used with a link back to the software's documentation (major thanks for taking the time to do that!). In some cases there may have been slight formatting modifications made. In any case, if descriptions are not original credit will be properly given to the source. annotation \u00b6 The annotation directory will contain the outputs from Prokka annotation. These outputs include FASTA (proteins and genes), GFF3, GenBank, and many more. By default the included Prokka databases are used for annotation. However, if a Species Specific Dataset was a created the RefSeq clustered proteins are used first for annotation.

We will use S. aureus samples associated with cystic fibrosis lung infections that were recently published (details below, shameless self plug!) and are available from BioProject accession PRJNA480016 . Bernardy, Eryn E., et al. \"Whole-Genome Sequences of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates from Cystic Fibrosis Lung Infections.\" Microbiol Resour Announc 8.3 (2019): e01564-18. Overall the goal of the tutorial is to: Build datasets Acquire Staphopia datasets Use Bactopia to process: A sample from SRA/ENA Multiple samples from SRA/ENA Single local sample Multiple local samples using FOFN Bactopia Should Be Installed This tutorial assumes you have already installed Bactopia. If you have not, please check out how to at Installation . Build Datasets \u00b6 First let's create a directory to work in and activate our Bactopia environment. mkdir bactopia-tutorial cd bactopia-tutorial conda activate bactopia Now we are ready to build our datasets! bactopia datasets datasets/ --ariba \"vfdb_core,card\" \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --include_genus \\ --cpus 4 Let's review what is happening here. datasets/ is where our datasets will be downloaded, processed and stored. --ariba \"vfdb_core,card\" says to download and setup the VFDB Core and the CARD databases to be used by Ariba. --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" will download MLST schemas associated with S. aureus it will also download completed S. aureus genomes (RefSeq only) that are used to create a set of protein set for annotation, a Mash sketch for automatic variant calling to the nearest neighbor, and calulate genome size statistics. --include_genus will also download completed genomes from the Staphylococcus genus that will be used for the protein set. These completed genomes are not used for the sketch creation or genome size calculation. --cpus 4 will use 4 cpus for downloading and the clustering step. Adjust this number according to your setup! Use CARD over MEGARes Staphopia v1 made use of MEGARes, for the purposes of this tutorial we are going to use the CARD database instead. If all goes well, the newly created datasets are now available in the folder datasets/ . We have now completed the dataset creation step! Pat yourself on the back! Next we'll supplement these datasets with some optional S. aureus specific datasets. Acquire Staphopia Datasets \u00b6 Staphopia includes a few optional datasets such as S. aureus N315 reference genome and SCCmec sequences (primers, proteins, full cassettes). We will acquire these files using the Bactopia Datasets GitHub repository. For this tutorial a Staphopia v1 branch has been created, which includes this optional dataset. Now let's clone the repository. git clone -b staphopia-v1 https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia-datasets.git Next we'll copy the files into our recently built datasets folder and delete the bactopia-datasets repository since we no longer need it. cp -r bactopia-datasets/species-specific/ datasets/ rm -rf bactopia-datasets/ ~Voil\u00e0! That should be it. You should now have the Staphopia v1 datasets included with your recentely built datasets (e.g. S. aureus protein clusters, RefSeq sketch, etc...) Running Bactopia \u00b6 OK! Get your servers started up! It is time to get processing! Samples on SRA \u00b6 Single Sample \u00b6 Let's start this by downloading a single sample from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and processing it through Bactopia. bactopia --accession SRX4563634 \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir ena-single-sample So, what's happening here? --accession SRX4563634 is telling Bactopia to download FASTQs associated with Exeriment accession SRX4563634. --datasets datasets/ tells Bactopia your pre-built datasets are in the folder datasets . --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" tells Bactopia, within the datasets folder, use the species specific dataset for S. aureus . --coverage 100 will limit the cleaned up FASTQ file to an estimated 100x coverage based on the genome size. --genome_size median tells Bactopia to use the median genome size of completed S. aureus genomes. The minimum, maximum, median, and mean genome sizes were calculated during the dataset building step. If a genome size was not given, it would have been estimated by Mash. --cpus 2 tells Bactopia to use a maximum of 2 cpus per process. Adjust this parameter to fit your setup! --outdir ena-single-sample tells Bactopia to dump the results into the ena-single-sample folder. Please keep in mind, this will not stop Nextflow from creating files (.nextflow, trace.txt, etc...) and directories (work and .nextflow/) within your current directory. Use --use_ena to download from ENA If you append --use_ena to the command above the FASTQ files for SRX4563634 will be downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) instead of SRA. Once you launch this command, sit back, relax and watch the Nextflow give realtime updates for SRX4563634's analysis! The approximate completion time is ~15-30 minutes depending on the number of cpus given and download times from ENA. Once complete, the results from numerous tools available to you in ena-single-sample/SRX4563634/ . Multiple Samples \u00b6 Now we are going to have Bactopia download and process 5 samples from ENA. To do this we can use the bactopia search function. bactopia search PRJNA480016 --limit 5 This will produce three files: ena-accessions.txt , ena-results.txt and ena-summary.txt . To learn more about these files see Generating Accession List . For this tutorial, ena-accessions.txt is the file we need. It contains five Experiment accessions, a single one per line. Just like this: SRX4563688 SRX4563687 SRX4563686 SRX4563689 SRX4563690 Note: you may have 5 different accessions from the PRJNA480016 project. To process these samples, we will adjust our command used previously. bactopia --accessions ena-accessions.txt \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir ena-multiple-samples Instead of --accession we are now using --accessions ena-accessions.txt which tells Bactopia to read ena-accessions.txt , and download each Experiment accession from SRA (for ENA add --use_ena ) and then process it. At this point, you might want to go for a walk or make yourself a coffee! This step has an approximate completion time of ~45-120 minutes , which again is fully dependent on the cpus used and the download times from SRA (or ENA). Once this is complete, the results for all five samples will be found in the ena-multiple-samples directory. Each sample will have there own folder of results. Local Samples \u00b6 So for the local samples, we're going to recycle some of the samples we downloaded from SRA/ENA. First let's make a directory to put the FASTQs into: mkdir fastqs Now let's move some the FASTQs from our SRX4563634 sample into this folder. cp ena-single-sample/SRX4563634/quality-control/SRX4563634*.fastq.gz fastqs/ Finally let's also make a single-end version of SRX4563634. cat fastqs/SRX4563634*.fastq.gz > fastqs/SRX4563634-SE.fastq.gz OK! Now we are ready to continue the tutorial! Single Sample \u00b6 Again we'll mostly be using the same parameters as previous, but with a few new ones. To process a single sample you can use the --R1 / --R2 (paired-end), --SE (single-end), and --sample parameters. Paired-End \u00b6 For paired-end reads you will want to use --R1 , --R2 , and --sample . For this paired-end example we'll use SRX4563634 again which we've copied to the fastqs folder. bactopia --R1 fastqs/SRX4563634_R1.fastq.gz \\ --R2 fastqs/SRX4563634_R2.fastq.gz \\ --sample SRX4563634 \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir local-single-sample Now Bactopia will recognize the --R1 and --R2 parameters as paired-end reads and process. The --sample is required and will be used for naming the output. Similar to the single SRA/ENA sample, the approximate completion time is ~15-30 minutes depending on the number of cpus given. Once complete, results can be found in local-single-sample/SRX4563634/ . Single-End \u00b6 In the case of Illumina reads, you're very unlikely to produce single-end reads, but they do exist in the wild (early days of Illumina!). Nevertheless, because single-end reads do exist, single-end support was built into Bactopia. To analyze single-end reads, the --SE parameter will replace --R1 and --R2 . bactopia --SE fastqs/SRX4563634-SE.fastq.gz \\ --sample SRX4563634-SE \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir local-single-sample Now SRX4563634-SE will be processed as a single-end sample. For single-end processing there are some paired-end only analyses (e.g. error correction, insertion sequences) that will be skipped. This leads to single-end samples being processed a little bit faster than pair-end samples. But, the approximate completion time is still ~15-30 minutes . Once complete, you'll the results from numerous tools available to you in local-single-sample/SRX4563634-SE/ . If you made it this far, you're almost done! Multiple Samples (FOFN) \u00b6 Here we go! The final way you can process samples in Bactopia! Bactopia allows you to give a text file describing the input samples. This file of file names (FOFN), contains sample names and location to associated FASTQs. The Bactopia FOFN format is described in detail at Basic Usage -> Multiple Samples . First we'll need to prepare a FOFN describing the FASTQ files in our fastqs folder. We can use bactopia prepare to do so: bactopia prepare fastqs/ > fastqs.txt This command will try to create a FOFN for you. For this turorial, the FASTQ names are pretty straight forward and should produce a correct FOFN (or at least it should! ... hopefully!). If that wasn't the case for you, there are ways to tweak bactopia prepare . Now we can use the --fastqs parameters to process samples in the FOFN. bactopia --fastqs fastqs.txt \\ --datasets datasets/ \\ --species \"Staphylococcus aureus\" \\ --coverage 100 \\ --genome_size median \\ --cpus 2 \\ --outdir local-multiple-samples We no longer need --R1 , --R2 , --SE , or --sample as the values for these parameters can be determined from the FOFN. Here it is, the final wait! This step has an approximate completion time of ~45-120 minutes . So, you will definitely want to go for a walk or make yourself a coffee! You've earned it! Once this is complete, the results for each sample (within their own folder) will be found in the local-multiple-samples directory. FOFN is more cpu efficient, making it faster The real benefit of using the FOFN method to process multiple samples is Nextflow's queue system will make better use of cpus. Processing multiple samples one at a time (via --R1 / --R2 or --SE ) will lead more instances of jobs waiting on other jobs to finish, during which cpus aren't being used. What's next? \u00b6 That should do it! Hopefully you have succeeded (yay! \ud83c\udf89) and would like to use Bactopia on your own data! In this tutorial we covered how to build datasets ( bactopia datasets ) and how process samples. We also covered the bactopia search and bactopia prepare to prepare file for multiple sample processing.

Each of these tools may (or may not) have there own configurable parameters for you to tweak. In order to facilitate getting started with Bactopia, this section has been limited to discussion of only a few parameters. However, if you are interested in the full list of configurable parameters in Bactopia, please check out the Complete Usage section. Usage \u00b6 Required Parameters: ### For Procesessing Multiple Samples --fastqs STR An input file containing the sample name and absolute paths to FASTQ/FASTAs to process ### For Processing A Single Sample --R1 STR First set of reads for paired end in compressed (gzip) FASTQ format --R2 STR Second set of reads for paired end in compressed (gzip) FASTQ format --SE STR Single end set of reads in compressed (gzip) FASTQ format --hybrid The SE should be treated as long reads for hybrid assembly. --sample STR The name of the input sequences ### For Downloading from SRA/ENA or NCBI Assembly **Note: Assemblies will have error free Illumina reads simulated for processing.** --accessions An input file containing ENA/SRA Experiment accessions or NCBI Assembly accessions to be processed --accession A single ENA/SRA Experiment accession or NCBI Assembly accession to be processed ### For Processing an Assembly **Note: The assembly will have error free Illumina reads simulated for processing.** --assembly STR A assembled genome in compressed FASTA format. --reassemble The simulated reads will be used to create a new assembly. Default: Use the original assembly, do not reassemble Dataset Parameters: --datasets DIR The path to available datasets that have already been set up --species STR Determines which species-specific dataset to use for the input sequencing Optional Parameters: --coverage INT Reduce samples to a given coverage Default: 100x --genome_size INT Expected genome size (bp) for all samples, a value of '0' will disable read error correction and read subsampling. Special values (requires --species): 'min': uses minimum completed genome size of species 'median': uses median completed genome size of species 'mean': uses mean completed genome size of species 'max': uses max completed genome size of species Default: Mash estimate --outdir DIR Directory to write results to Default: . Nextflow Queue Parameters: At execution, Nextflow creates a queue and the number of slots in the queue is determined by the total number of cores on the system. When a task is submitted to the queue, the total number of slots it occupies is determined by the value set by \"--cpus\". This can have a significant effect on the efficiency of the Nextflow's queue system. If \"--cpus\" is set to a value that is equal to the number of cores availabe, in most cases only a single task will be able to run because its occupying all available slots. When in doubt, \"--cpus 4\" is a safe bet, it is also the default value if you don't use \"--cpus\". --max_time INT The maximum number of minutes a single task should run before being halted. Default: 240 minutes --max_memory INT The maximum amount of memory (Gb) allowed to a single task. Default: 32 Gb --cpus INT Number of processors made available to a single task. Default: 39 Nextflow Related Parameters: --infodir DIR Directory to write Nextflow summary files to Default: ./bactopia-info --condadir DIR Directory to Nextflow should use for Conda environments Default: Bactopia's Nextflow directory --nfconfig STR A Nextflow compatible config file for custom profiles. This allows you to create profiles specific to your environment (e.g. SGE, AWS, SLURM, etc...). This config file is loaded last and will overwrite existing variables if set. Default: Bactopia's default configs --nfdir Print directory Nextflow has pulled Bactopia to --overwrite Nextflow will overwrite existing output files. Default: false --conatainerPath Path to Singularity containers to be used by the 'slurm' profile. Default: /opt/bactopia/singularity --sleep_time After reading datases, the amount of time (seconds) Nextflow will wait before execution. Default: 1 seconds --publish_mode Set Nextflow's method for publishing output files. Allowed methods are: 'copy' (default) Copies the output files into the published directory. 'copyNoFollow' Copies the output files into the published directory without following symlinks ie. copies the links themselves. 'link' Creates a hard link in the published directory for each process output file. 'rellink' Creates a relative symbolic link in the published directory for each process output file. 'symlink' Creates an absolute symbolic link in the published directory for each process output file. Default: copy --force Nextflow will overwrite existing output files. Default: false -resume Nextflow will attempt to resume a previous run. Please notice it is only a single '-' Useful Parameters: --available_datasets Print a list of available datasets found based on location given by \"--datasets\" --example_fastqs Print example of expected input for FASTQs file --check_fastqs Verify \"--fastqs\" produces the expected inputs --compress Compress (gzip) select outputs (e.g. annotation, variant calls) to reduce overall storage footprint. --keep_all_files Keeps all analysis files created. By default, intermediate files are removed.

Bactopia can process Illumina FASTQs, assemblies, and long reads for hybrid assembly. Illumina FASTQs a can be your local FASTQs or a Experiment accession to download associated FASTQs from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) . Likewise assemblies can be local, or a GenBank/RefSeq accession to download from NCBI Assembly. Input assemblies will have Illumina reads simulated so that the complete Bactopia pipeline run. By default, the assembly will not be reassembled. Which approach really depends on what you need to achieve! The following sections describe methods to process single samples, multiple samples, downloading samples from the ENA. Local \u00b6 Single Sample \u00b6 When you only need to process a single sample at a time, Bactopia allows that! You only have to the sample name ( --sample ) and the whether the read set is paired-end ( --R1 and --R2 ), single-end ( --SE ), Illumina paired-end + long reads ( --hybrid ), or an assembly ( --assembly ). Use --R1, --R2 for Paired-End FASTQs bactopia --sample my-sample --R1 /path/to/my-sample_R1.fastq.gz --R2 /path/to/my-sample_R2.fastq.gz Use --SE for Single-End FASTQs bactopia --sample my-sample --SE /path/to/my-sample.fastq.gz Use --R1, --R2, --SE, and --hybrid for Paired-End FASTQs with Long Reads At the assembly step, Unicycler will be used to create a hybrid assembly using the paired-end reads and the long reads. bactopia --sample my-sample --R1 /path/to/my-sample_R1.fastq.gz \\ --R2 /path/to/my-sample_R2.fastq.gz \\ --SE /path/to/my-sample.fastq.gz \\ --hybrid Use --assembly for an assembled FASTA Assemblies will have 2x250bp Illumina reads simulated without insertions or deletions in the sequence and a minimum PHRED score of Q33. By default, the input assembly will be used for all downstream analyses (e.g. annotation) which use an assembly. If the --reassemble parameter is given, then the a assembly will be created from the simulated reads. bactopia --sample my-sample --assembly /path/to/my-sample.fna.gz Multiple Samples \u00b6 For multiple samples, you must create a file with information about the inputs, a file of filenames (FOFN). This file specifies sample names and location of FASTQs/FASTAs to be processed. Using this information, paired-end, single-end, hybrid or assembly information can be extracted as well as naming output files. While this is an additional step for you, the user, it helps to avoid potential pattern matching errors. Most importantly, by taking this approach, you can process hundreds of samples in a single command. There is also the added benefit of knowing which FASTQs were analysed and their location at a later time!

ENA & SRA \u00b6 There are a lot of publicly avilable sequences available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). There's a good chance you might want to include some of those sequences in your analysis! If that sounds like you, Bactopia has that built in for you! You can give a single Experiment accession ( --accession ) or a file where each line is a single Experiment accession ( --accessions ). Bactopia will then query ENA to determine Run accession(s) associated with the given Experiment accession and proceed download the corresponding FASTQ files from either the SRA (default) or ENA ( --use_ena ). After the download is completed, it will be processed through Bactopia. Use --accession for a Single Experiment Accession SRA: bactopia --accession SRX476958 ENA: bactopia --accession SRX476958 --use_ena Use --accessions for Multiple Experiment Accessions SRA: bactopia --accessions my-accessions.txt ENA: bactopia --accessions my-accessions.txt --use_ena What happens when an Experiment has multiple Runs? In cases where a single Experiment might have multiple Run accessions associated with it, the FASTQ files from each Run are merged into a single set of sequences. Generating Accession List \u00b6 bactopia search has been made to help assist in generating a list of Experiment accessions to be procesed by Bactopia (via --accessions ). Users can provide a Taxon ID (e.g. 1280), a binary name (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), a Study accession (e.g. PRJNA480016), a BioSample accession (e.g. SAMN01737350), or a Run accession (e.g. SRR578340). This value is then queried against ENA's Data Warehouse API ), and a list of all Experiment accessions associated with the query is returned.

So if you have a 24-core system, that means Nextflow will have a queue with 24-slots available. This feature kind of makes --cpus a little misleading. Typically when you give --cpus you are saying \"use this amount of cpus\" . But that is not the case for Nextflow and Bactopia. When you use --cpus what you are actually saying is \"for any particular task, use this amount of slots\" . Commands within a task processors will use the amount specified by --cpus . --cpus can have a significant effect on the efficiency of Bactopia So for example if you have a system with 24-cores. This command, bactopia ... --cpus 24 , says for any particular task, use 24 slots . Nextflow will give tasks in Bactopia 24 slots out of 24 available (24-core machine). In other words the queue can one have one task running at once because each task occupies 24 slots. On the other hand, bactopia ... --cpus 4 says for any particular task, use 4 slots . Now, for Nextflow will give each task 4 slots out of 24 slots. Which means 6 tasks can be running at once. This can lead to much better efficiency because less jobs are stuck waiting in line. There are some tasks in Bactopia that will only ever use a single slot because they are single-core tasks. But for example the annotation step will always use the number of slots specified by --cpus . If the --cpus is too high, the annotation will get bogged down, which causes tasks dependent on annotation to also get bogged down. When in doubt --cpus 4 is a safe value. This is also the default value for Bactopia. --genome_size \u00b6 Throughout the Bactopia workflow a genome size is used for various tasks. By default, a genome size is estimated using Mash. However, users can provide their own value for genome size, use values based on Species Specific Datasets , or completely disable it. Value Result empty Mash is used to estimate the genome size integer Uses the genome size (e.g. --genome_size 2800000 ) provided by the user 0 Read error correct and read subsampling will be disabled. min Requires --species , the minimum completed genome size for a species is used median Requires --species , the median completed genome size for a species is used mean Requires --species , the mean completed genome size for a species is used max Requires --species , the maximum completed genome size for a species is used Mash may not be the most accurate estimate Mash is very convenient to quickly estimate a genome size, but it may not be the most accurate in all cases and will differ between samples. It is recommended that when possible a known genome size or one based off completed genomes should be used. --nfconfig \u00b6 A key feature of Nextflow is you can provide your own config files. What this boils down to you can easily set Bactopia to run on your environment. With --nfconfig you can tell Bactopia to import your config file. --nfconfig has been set up so that it is the last config file to be loaded by Nextflow. This means that if your config file contains variables (e.g. params or profiles) already set they will be overwritten by your values. Nextflow goes into great details on how to create configuration files. Please check the following links for adjustsments you be interested in making. Scope Description env Set any environment variables that might be required params Change the default values of command line arguments process Adjust perprocess configurations such as containers, conda envs, or resource usage profile Create predefined profiles for your Executor There are many other scopes that you might be interested in checking out. You are most like going to want to create a custom profile. By doing so you can specify it at runtime ( -profile myProfile ) and Nextflow will be excuted based on that profile. Often times your custom profile will include information on the executor (queues, allocations, apths, etc...). If you need help please reach out ! If you're using the standard profile (did not specify -profile 'xyz') this might not be necessary. -resume \u00b6 Bactopia relies on Nextflow's Resume Feature to resume runs. You can tell Bactopia to resume by adding -resume to your command line. When -resume is used, Nextflow will review the cache and determine if the previous run is resumable. If the previous run is not resumable, execution will start at the beginning. --keep_all_files \u00b6 In some processes, Bactopia will delete large intermediate files (e.g. multiple uncompressed FASTQs) only after a process successfully completes. Since this a per-process function, it does not affect Nextflow's ability to resume ( -resume )a workflow. You can deactivate this feature using --keep_all_files . Please, keep in mind the work directory is already large, this will make it 2-3 times larger.","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"usage-basic/#basic-usage-for-bactopia","text":"Bactopia is a wrapper around many different tools.

So if you have a 24-core system, that means Nextflow will have a queue with 24-slots available. This feature kind of makes --cpus a little misleading. Typically when you give --cpus you are saying \"use this amount of cpus\" . But that is not the case for Nextflow and Bactopia. When you use --cpus what you are actually saying is \"for any particular task, use this amount of slots\" . Commands within a task processors will use the amount specified by --cpus . --cpus can have a significant effect on the efficiency of Bactopia So for example if you have a system with 24-cores. This command, bactopia ... --cpus 24 , says for any particular task, use 24 slots . Nextflow will give tasks in Bactopia 24 slots out of 24 available (24-core machine). In other words the queue can one have one task running at once because each task occupies 24 slots. On the other hand, bactopia ... --cpus 4 says for any particular task, use 4 slots . Now, for Nextflow will give each task 4 slots out of 24 slots. Which means 6 tasks can be running at once. This can lead to much better efficiency because less jobs are stuck waiting in line. There are some tasks in Bactopia that will only ever use a single slot because they are single-core tasks. But for example the annotation step will always use the number of slots specified by --cpus . If the --cpus is too high, the annotation will get bogged down, which causes tasks dependent on annotation to also get bogged down. When in doubt --cpus 4 is a safe value. This is also the default value for Bactopia.","title":"--cpus"},{"location":"usage-complete/#-genome_size","text":"Throughout the Bactopia workflow a genome size is used for various tasks.

Always Enabled Steps \u00b6 The Always Enabled Steps are always executed by Bactopia. These steps do not depend of external datasets and thus are always enabled. Gather FASTQs \u00b6 Specifies exactly where the input FASTQ/FASTAs are coming from. If you are using local inputs (e.g. --R1/--R2 , --fastqs ) it will verify they can be accessed. If an accession(s) ( --accession or --accessions ) was given, the corresponding FASTQs (SRA/ENA) or assemblies (NCBI Assembly) are downloaded in this step. All assemblies will have 2x250bp Illumina reads simulated withour insertions or deletions and a minimum PHRED score of Q33. Software Usage ART Generate simulated Illumina reads from an assembly ena-dl Download FASTQ files from ENA ncbi-genome-download Download GenBank/RefSeq assemblies from NCBI Assembly database Validate FASTQs \u00b6 Determines if the FASTQ file contains enough sequencing to continue processing. The --min_reads and --min_basepairs parameters adjust the minimum amount of sequencing required to continue processing. This step does not directly test the validity of the FASTQ format (although, it would fail if the format is invalid!). Software Usage fastq-scan Determine total read and basepairs of FASTQ Original Summary \u00b6 Produces summary statistics (read lengths, quality scores, etc...) based on the original input FASTQs. Software Usage FastQC Generates a HTML report of original FASTQ summary statistics fastq-scan Generates original FASTQ summary statistics in JSON format Genome Size \u00b6 The genome size is by various programs in the Bactopia workflow. By default, if no genome size is given one is estimated using Mash. Otherwise, a specific genome size can be specified or completely disabled using the --genome_size parameter. See Genome Size Parameter to learn more about specifying the genome size. Software Usage Mash If not given, estimates genome size of sample Quality Control \u00b6 The input FASTQs go through a few clean up steps. First, Illumina related adapters and phiX contaminants are removed. Then reads that fail to pass length and/or quality requirements are filtered out. If the genome size is available, sequence error-corrections are made and the total sequencing is reduced to a specified coverage. After this step, all downstream analyses are based on the QC'd FASTQ and the original is no longer used. Software Description BBTools Removes Illumina adapters, phiX contaminants, filters reads based on length and quality score, and reduces inputs to a specified coverage.

Software Usage Mash Produces a sketch ( k =21,31) of tje QC'd FASTQ Sourmash Produces a signature ( k =21,31,51) of the QC'd FASTQ De novo Assembly \u00b6 The QC'd FASTQs are assembled using the Shovill pipeline. This allows for a seamless assembly process using MEGAHIT , SKESA , SPAdes or Velvet . Alternatively, if long reads are available to complement Illumina paired-end reads, hybrid assembly is available through Unicycler . Software Usage assembly-scan Generates summary statistics of the final assembly Shovill Manages multiple steps in the Illumina assembly process Unicycler Manages multiple steps in the hybrid assembly process Assembly Quality Assessment \u00b6 After assembly, the de novo assembly is assessed for its biological (e.g. containment & contamination) as well as its technical (e.g. misassemblies and errors) quality using CheckM and QUAST . Software Usage CheckM Assess the biological quality of a de novo assembly based on presence of marker genes QUAST Gives a summary on the technical (e.g. misassemblies etc) quality of a de novo assembly Genome Annotation \u00b6 Genes are predicted and annotated from the assembled genome using Prokka . If available, a clustered RefSeq protein set is used for the first pass of annotation. Software Usage Prokka Predicts and annotates assembled genomes Antimicrobial Resistance \u00b6 Searches for antimicrobial resistance genes and assosiated point mutations in the annotated gene and protein sequences. If datasets are available, local assemblies can also be used to predict antibiotic resistance. Software Usage AMRFinderPlus Predicts antimicrobial resistance based on genes and point mutations Dataset Enabled Steps \u00b6 The remaining Dataset Enabled Steps require supplemental datasets to be available to be executed. There are many datasets available that Bactopia can take advantage of. To learn more about setting up these datasets, check out Build Datasets . These datasets can be broken into two groups, Public Datasets and User Datasets . Public Datasets \u00b6 Publicly available datasets can be used for further analysis. Call Variants (Auto) \u00b6 Variants are predicted using Snippy . The QC'd FASTQs are aligned to the nearest (based on Mash distance) RefSeq completed genome. By default, only the nearest genome is selected, but multiple genomes can be selected ( --max_references ) or this feature can be completely disabled ( disable_auto_variants ). Software Usage Bedtools Generates the per-base coverage of the reference alignment NCBI Genome Download Downloads the RefSeq completed genome Snippy Manages multiple steps in the haploid variant calling process vcf-annotator Adds annotations from reference GenBank to the final VCF Local Assembly \u00b6 Using available Ariba reference datasets , determines which reference sequences were found with an additional detailed report summarizing the results. Software Usage Ariba Creates local assemblies of reference sequences Minmer Query \u00b6 Screens QC'd FASTQs and signatures against available Minmer Datasets . Software Usage Mash Screens against RefSeq and/or PLSDB sketches Sourmash Screens signature against GenBank Sequence Type \u00b6 Uses a PubMLST.org MLST schema to determine the sequence type of the sample. Software Usage Ariba Runs QC'd FASTQ against a MLST database BLAST Aligns MLST loci against the assembled genome User Datasets \u00b6 Another option is for users to provide their own data to include in the analysis.

These workflows use the predictable directory structure of Bactopia to automate analyses. Common Inputs \u00b6 With the exceptions of the summary tool, each Bactopia Tool will use the following input parameters: --bactopia STR Directory containing Bactopia analysis results for all samples. --exclude STR A text file containing sample names to exclude from the analysis. The expected format is a single sample per line. --include STR A text file containing sample names to include in the analysis. The expected format is a single sample per line. --bactiopia \u00b6 This parameter tells each tool where to find your Bactopia outputs from your project. Using this path, the tool will identify the required inputs and begin analysis. What this means is there is no need for you to wrangle up input files for compartive analyses. --exclude \u00b6 What --exclude allows is for you to give a text file with a list of samples that should probably be excluded from further analyses. While you can produce this list yourself, the summary tool will produce a list of samples that do not pass certain thresholds. These thresholds are based on read lengths, sequence quality, coverage and assembly quality. You can adjust these thresholds to meet your needs. --include \u00b6 Similarly, --include allows you to give a text file with a list of samples to be included in the analysis.

Often times, you may also want to include completed genomes in your pan-genome analysis. This is possible with the pirate tool. If you use the --species parameter, all completed genomes available from RefSeq will be downloaded with ncbi-genome-download and reannotated with Prokka (to make compatible gffs). You can also use the core genome alignment, produced by PIRATE, to create a core genome phylogeny using ClonalFrameMl , maskrc-svg , and IQ-TREE . The core genome pair-wise SNP distance for each sample is also calculated with snp-dists . Example \u00b6 The following command will run PIRATE, on a set of samples in the include file.
